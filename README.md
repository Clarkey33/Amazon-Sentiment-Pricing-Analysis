# Predicting-Price-Ranges-of-Amazon-Products
Abstract 
This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer sentiment from Amazon product reviews to address the problem of declining product sales. The goal is to predict the best pricing tactics to increase an electronics manufacturing and retail company's profitability. 
The study uses an organized methodology that includes web scraping for data collection, preprocessing the data for text analysis, and producing models with the help of algorithms for linear and random forest regression. Essential techniques like sentiment scoring and n-gram analysis are used to glean insights from customer reviews. 
Both classification models, Random Forest Classifier (TF-IDF vectorizer) and Logistic Regression (TF-IDF vectorizer) had 72% and 79% accuracy, respectively. The results illustrate practical approaches to product design and marketing that consider customer sentiment and preferences.  This will not only hedge the current problem of decreased sales but also create a new trend of data-based decision-making in Product Management.
